Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection for [SemEval 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/pcl-detection-semeval2022/)

The Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection Task is based on the paper [Don't Patronize Me! An annotated Dataset with Patronizing and Condescending Language Towards Vulnerable Communities](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-main.518/) (Perez-Almendros et al., 2020).

## Objectives

- Identify PCL (Patronizing and Condescending Language) and categorize the linguistic techniques used to express it specifically when referring to communities identified as being vulnerable to unfrair treatment in the media

## Dataset

- Paragraphs extracted from news articles in English
- Given a paragraph, generate a system capable of predicting whether it contains PCL or not
- And, whether it contains any of the 7 categoories identified in the PCL taxonomy introduced in the original paper
